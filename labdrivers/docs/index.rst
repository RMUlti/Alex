Welcome to labdrivers' documentation!
======================================

labdrivers is a Python module containing a collection of drivers for common research lab instruments.

It contains a suite of instrument-specific drivers which can be used to 
interface measurement hardware with Python code, along with a set of 
Jupyter notebooks demonstrating example use cases.
The drivers within the project are intended to be used 'manually', either in python scripts or in Jupyter notebooks.

Labdrivers is not a measurement framework with a GUI; if that's what you're looking for 
then you might want to check out one of the projects listed at https://github.com/pyinstruments/pyinstruments.

Organization of the project
----------------------------

Drivers within the project are organized by instrument brand. Each
instrument manufacturer has its own submodule under the :code:`labdrivers` namespace, and
each individual instrument driver is in a file named after the class which
implements the driver.

Currently labdrivers contains drivers for the following instruments::

   labdrivers/
   |-- keithley
       `-- keithley2400.py
   |-- lakeshore
       `-- ls332.py
   |-- ni
       `-- nidaq.py
   |-- oxford
       |-- itc503.py
       |-- ips120.py
       |-- mercuryips.py
       `-- triton200.py
   |-- quantumdesign
       `-- qdinstrument.py
   |-- srs
       `-- sr830.py

So for example, to load the driver for a Keithley 2400 SMU::

    from labdrivers.keithley import keithley2400
